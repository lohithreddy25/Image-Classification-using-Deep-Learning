# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

Understanding the Task

Image classification is a core task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a specific label or category to an input image. The CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark in machine learning, offers a diverse collection of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes.   

The CIFAR-10 Dataset

The ten classes in CIFAR-10 are:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Deep Learning Approach: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the de facto standard for image classification tasks. These neural networks are specifically designed to process grid-like data, such as images, by exploiting the spatial correlation between pixels.   

Key Components of a CNN for Image Classification:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to the input image, extracting features like edges, textures, and shapes.   
Activation Functions: Non-linear functions like ReLU introduce non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns.   
Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the feature maps, reducing computational complexity and mitigating overfitting.   
Fully Connected Layers: These layers connect all neurons from one layer to all neurons in the next layer, enabling the network to make a final classification decision.   
Softmax Layer: This layer outputs a probability distribution over the 10 classes, indicating the likelihood of the input image belonging to each class.   
Building and Training a CNN

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

Data Preprocessing:
Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Normalize pixel values to a common range (e.g., 0-1).
Create training and validation sets.
Model Architecture:
Design the CNN architecture, specifying the number of convolutional layers, filters, kernel size, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Choose an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) and loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).   
Training:
Feed training data into the network, calculating the loss between predicted and true labels.
Backpropagate the error to update the network's weights and biases.
Iterate this process for multiple epochs.
Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
